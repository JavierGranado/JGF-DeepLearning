Visualize deeper layers in CIFAR10 under Tensorflow by displaying images which gain the highest response from neurons. Written for cifar10 model (by KUKURUZA).

TODO: Adapting the code in Alexnet model under Tensorflow to get the information about this output layers for locate objetcs in input images to avoid objects image processing of unwanted objects.
